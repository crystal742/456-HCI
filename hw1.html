        <h3>2 Good user interfaces:</h3>
        <p> 1.	YouTube has a very good user interface especially on their web application. It allows to play videos from all over the world, that users choose to upload. I think their playback ability is very nice, I like listening to videos when I fall asleep. It is also very easy to navigate using their subscriptions, explore page, or the search bar. I think that YouTube’s playlist interface could improve. I like to make music video playlists but it can be very hard with their design. There’s no good shuffle options and not a great way of rearranging very large music playlists. </p>
        <p> 2.	Another good user interface would be Spotify. I love using Spotify because it is very easy to navigate AND find new music. They have tons of option for exploring new music and their yearly review of what music you listened to is super fun and interactive. Many have followed their lead and created “story-like” reviews of your year with them on their app. Apple music started doing it and I even saw it on Robinhood. Although I love the many options of exploring sometimes when I am in a hurry like driving, I do think their interface can be bit overwhelming. Other than that I love using the application. </p>
